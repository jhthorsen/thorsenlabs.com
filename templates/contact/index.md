Ways to get in touch
====================

The most convenient way is to send an email to
[hei@thorsen.pm](mailto:hei@thorsen.pm).

If you want to talk to me interactively, you might be able to reach me on IRC: I’m on
[libera.chat](https://libera.chat/) as “[batman](irc://irc.libera.chat:6697/batman)“.

I also have accounts on the following social media platforms: Facebook,
Instagram, LINE, Reddit, Signal Skype, Stackoverflow, Telegram and WhatsApp.
But sending me a message on ex. Facebook is probably a dead end, since I hardly
ever check “message requests”.

Add this key to your `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` if you want me to get access to
your server.
